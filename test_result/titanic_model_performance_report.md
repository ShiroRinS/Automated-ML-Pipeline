## üîÆ Model Testing Results

### Sample Prediction Analysis

| Passenger | Profile | Prediction | Survival Probability | Analysis |
|-----------|---------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| 1 | 22yr Male, 3rd Class, Southampton | **Did Not Survive** | 10.0% | Young male in lower class - high risk |
| 2 | 38yr Female, 1st Class, Cherbourg | **Survived** | 100.0% | Female in upper class - optimal survival conditions |
| 3 | 26yr Female, 2nd Class, Southampton | **Survived** | 86.2% | Female in middle class - good survival odds |
| 4 | 35yr Male, 1st Class, Southampton | **Did Not Survive** | 32.0% | Male gender reduces survival despite upper class |
| 5 | 27yr Female, 3rd Class, Southampton | **Did Not Survive** | 42.0% | Female advantage offset by lower class status |

### Feature Importance Analysis
1. **Gender (Sex)**: Primary survival predictor - females had significantly higher survival rates
2. **Passenger Class (Pclass)**: Strong economic indicator - higher classes had better access to lifeboats
3. **Age**: Important factor - children and younger passengers prioritized
4. **Fare**: Economic indicator correlating with class and survival resources
5. **Embarkation Port**: Secondary factor indicating passenger demographics
6. **Family Size (SibSp/Parch)**: Moderate impact on survival decisions
